# 20.3.4 Von Neumann

In this assignment, you will look into how a Central Processing Unit (CPU) works. The main function of this is to introduce you to how the CPU gets information, decodes it, and then runs that information. When you are done, your goal is to know that the CPU is more than a little square chip that lives on the motherboard.

## Scene 1: Naming, Defining, and Drawing Parts of the CPU

You can use the following resource for information:  
[Cambridge IGCSE (0478-0984) 3.1 Von Neumann Architecture](https://youtu.be/C0Pch0zpsT4?si=gsfLqKvPolqbS-eX).

### Basic Components of the CPU

Please draw out the CPU and provide clear and concise explanations for each of the following components:

- **Register**  
- **Program Counter**  
- **Memory Address Register (MAR)**  
- **Memory Data Register (MDR)**  
- **Accumulator**  
- **Control Unit (CU)**  
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**  
- **Cache**  
- **Clock**  
- **RAM Memory**

## Scene 2: Fetch, Decode, and Execute

Along with information from Part 1, please use the following video:  
[Cambridge IGCSE (0478-0984) 3.1 Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle](https://youtu.be/8Qx6Dr_aKXs?si=TngWJuJdOPhJI5mk).

### Tasks:

- Briefly explain and show the **Fetch, Decode, and Execute** cycles.  
- Explain and demonstrate how information moves through the CPU to perform basic math calculations.  
- Develop a creative and interactive way to show how the CPU works using the fetch, decode, and execute cycles.  
- Show the flow of data through the computer.

---

## Scene 3: Opcode & Operands

### Tasks:

- Show and explain how **opcodes** and **operands** work inside the CPU using 8-bit opcodes/operands.  
- Define and explain how the CPU uses the following:  
  - **Opcodes**  
  - **Operands**

## Sample Code

```javascript
let sceneNum = 1;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(242, 48, 101);
  if (sceneNum === 1) {
    scene1();
  }
  if (sceneNum === 2) {
    scene2();
  }
}

function scene1() {
  background(220);
  let introText =
    "These are basic components of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Please draw out the CPU " +
    "and provide clear and concise definitions for each:\n" +
    "1. The Register\n" +
    "2. Program Counter\n" +
    "3. Memory Address Register (MAR)\n" +
    "4. Memory Data Register (MDR)\n" +
    "5. Accumulator\n" +
    "6. Control Unit (CU)\n" +
    "7. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)\n" +
    "8. Cache\n" +
    "9. Clock\n" +
    "10. RAM Memory";

  text(introText, 20, 20, 300); // x, y, max width
}

function scene2() {
  background(220);
  text("von() uses x,y,w,h,title,descriptX,descriptY,descript", 100, 50);
  von(50, 200, 100, 200, "title", 100, 100, "WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY");
}

function von(x, y, w, h, title, descriptX, descriptY, descript) {
  rect(x, y, w, h); // draws the box

  if (mouseX < x + w && mouseX > x && mouseY < y + h && mouseY > y) {
    // does the hit hitbox logic for your rollover.
    stroke("black");
    fill("black");
    text(title, mouseX, mouseY); // name of the block
    text(descript, descriptX, descriptY); // definition
    noFill();
  }
}

function mousePressed() {
  sceneNum++;
}
